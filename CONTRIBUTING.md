This project is open source, and your contributions are all welcome. There are mostly three different ways one can contribute to the project:

1. use Podop, either on test or on production servers, and report meaningful bugs when you find some;
2. write and publish, or contribute to mail distributions based on Podop, like Mailu;
2. contribute code and/or configuration to the repository (see [the development guidelines](https://mailu.io/contributors/guide.html) for details);

Either way, keep in mind that the code you write must be licensed under the same conditions as the project itself. Additionally, all contributors are considered equal co-authors of the project.
